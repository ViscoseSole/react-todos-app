A personal project in hopes of understanding a little more about components with state (or stateless components) communicating with each other, the binding of *this* and how to merge JavaScript with JSX when needed.

## Usage
1. `git clone https://github.com/ViscoseSole/react-todos-app`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Find project at `localhost:3000`
